                    <p>My name is Deepak.  I have lived in Bhadrak in Odisha. Some of my favorite things to do are read, listen to music and ride public transportation (buses and trains).
                        These are activities that I enjoy immensely  and indulge in daily.</p>
                        <p>My carrier aspirations are to become either a defence officer or a software engineer.
                            I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone person with "oddities".
                            I look up mostly to my family members, especially my mother, as a guiding figure in life.</p>
                            
                            <p>Favorite TV shows of  mine include Special Opps, Family Man, Criminal Justice and Friends.
                                Just a few things about me truly.</p>
